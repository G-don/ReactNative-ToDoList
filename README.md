##Description

This was my first experience using React Native technology, where I build a simple ToDo List app where we can save our goals. 


##Instructions

Tap on <Add new Goal> and then just enter the goal text, in order to save it press <Add goal>. When a goal is completed to remove the goal just double tap on it to remove it from the list. 


##Features
This is a simple app that allowed me to understand React Native, where we can save or delete goals. I will apply this knowledge to my drum machine project to make it an android and ios app. 


##Visuals

To help you better understand the flow and functionality of the ToDo List, I have included a package of screenshots. These visuals will give you an insight into the application's interface and guide you through its features.

##Contributing

Please feel free to send me your ideas or suggestions, feedback or feature requests or improvements, I would love to hear from you! 

##Licence

The ToDo List is released under the MIT licence.
